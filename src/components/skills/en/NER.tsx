    Named Entity Recognition (NER) classifies tokens in text into predefined categories (tags), such as <b>person names</b>, <b>quantity expressions</b>, <b>percentage expressions</b>, <b>names of locations</b>, <b>organizations</b>, as well as expression of <b>time</b>, <b>currency</b> and others. We can recognize up to 19 entities. DeepPavlov also features a multilingual model that is available for 104 languages.
